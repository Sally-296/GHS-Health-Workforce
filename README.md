# GHS-Health-Workforce
Project 2 of 4Tool4 Data Course-Cohort3

# 1.	Overview
This project presents an analytical overview of Ghana's health workforce distribution across all 16 administrative regions from 2020 to 2023. Using data from the Ghana Health Service (GHS), the objective was to visualize trends, identify regional disparities, and support data-driven decision-making in healthcare staffing.
# 2.	Objectives
The dashboard was designed to answer the following key questions:
-	How is the health workforce distributed across Ghana by region?
-	What is the year-by-year trends in staffing levels?
-	What is the minimum, average, and maximum numbers of health professionals per region?
-	Which regions consistently have the highest or lowest staffing numbers?
# 3. Methodology
**Step 1: Data Cleaning (Excel)**
-	Removed blank rows and corrected inconsistent column headers.
-	Standardized region names for consistency.
-	Converted all relevant data to numerical formats for accurate analysis.

**Step 2: Data Modeling & Aggregation (Power BI)**
-	Imported a single-table dataset.
-	Verified data types and cleaned categories.
-	Created measures for:
-	Average number of doctors
-	Yearly totals and changes
-	Region-wise maximum and minimum values

**Step 3: Visualization Design**
-	Developed dashboards for each year (2020-2023).
-	Used cards to display totals (Total, Average, Max, Min).
-	Applied bar charts to show regional comparisons.
# 4. Key Findings
-	Growth in Workforce: The number of medical doctors rose from 1,447 in 2020 to 2,063 in 2023 (43% increase).
-	Top Region: Greater Accra consistently had the highest number of doctors, reaching 702 in 2023. - Underserved Regions: Savannah, North East, and Ahafo regularly recorded fewer than 10 doctors per year.
-	Disparity Insight: In 2023, one district had 193 doctors, while others had zero, revealing sharp regional imbalances.
-	Stable Regions: Ashanti, Eastern, Central, and Western showed consistent yearly growth.
# 5. Interpretation & Recommendations
-	Policy Action: Focus on deploying more medical staff to underserved areas like Savannah and
Northeast through incentives and targeted programs.
-	Equity Planning: The data underscores the need for equitable resource distribution across regions.
-	Further Study: Future dashboards could include:
-	Gender breakdown of staff
-	Category-level profession analysis
-	Vacancy rates vs. filled positions
-	Sustainability: The dashboard can be updated annually and serve as a planning tool for GHS HR and policy teams.
# 6. Reflection
This project strengthened my proficiency in:
-	Real-world data cleaning using Excel.
-	Designing interactive dashboards in Power BI.
-	Translating data insights into meaningful recommendations.
-	Communicating stories through visual analytics.
